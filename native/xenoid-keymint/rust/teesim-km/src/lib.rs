// In-process KeyMint trusted application.

// Wraps the reference TA (kmr-ta) with a BoringSSL crypto backend and
// keybox-based attestation signing, and exposes a small request/response
// surface. The native interceptor decodes an intercepted IKeyMintDevice
// transaction into a kmr_wire request, calls `Ta::process`, and re-encodes the
// reply.

// Surface lossy integer casts crate-wide. The USER_SECURE_ID bug (#205) was a
// signed carrier sign-extending into a negative CBOR integer that kmr_wire then
// rejected; these lints (off by default) flag that shape. The value-marshaling
// boundary in `capi` upgrades them to `deny` on its conversion functions.
